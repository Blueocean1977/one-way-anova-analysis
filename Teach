Design:

Import the data into R.
Check the data for missing values and outliers.
Create a factor variable for the independent variable.
Create a numeric variable for the dependent variable.
Analysis:

Perform a one-way ANOVA on the data.
Check the assumptions of ANOVA.
Interpret the results of the ANOVA.
Perform post-hoc tests to compare the means of the groups.
Here is an example of how to perform a one-way ANOVA in R:

# Import the data.
data <- read.csv("data.csv")

# Check the data for missing values and outliers.
summary(data)

# Create a factor variable for the independent variable.
group <- factor(data$group)

# Create a numeric variable for the dependent variable.
dependent_variable <- data$dependent_variable

# Perform a one-way ANOVA on the data.
aov_results <- aov(dependent_variable ~ group, data)

# Check the assumptions of ANOVA.
# Levene's test for homogeneity of variance
leveneTest(dependent_variable ~ group, data)
# Shapiro-Wilk test for normality
shapiro.test(dependent_variable)

# Interpret the results of the ANOVA.
summary(aov_results)

# Perform post-hoc tests to compare the means of the groups.
TukeyHSD(aov_results)

This code will perform a one-way ANOVA on the data dataset, which contains data on the dependent variable 
and the independent variable. The assumptions of ANOVA will be checked, and the results of the ANOVA will 
be interpreted.
